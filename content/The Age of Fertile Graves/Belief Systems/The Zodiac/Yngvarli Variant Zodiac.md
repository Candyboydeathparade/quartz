[[The Fundamentalist Zodiac]]

Within the kingdoms of Yngvar, astrology is practiced in a somewhat precarious place. It is neither encouraged nor outlawed by [[The Iron-Blooded Kings]] and is seen differently depending on one's social status. Typically, the middle class have little care for it, the upper class delight in the novelty of it, the priest class hold it up with grim reverence, and the lower / slave caste hold onto it as a symbol of hope and something 'Greater' than their mortal suffering.
