The Fundamentalist Axiomite Zodiac is the most commonly studied framework for interpreting the movements of celestial bodies and their impact on the world, physical and spiritual. Unlike old-world Zodiacs, the signs of the Aximoite Zodiace relate to much broader concepts rather than to specific, singular creatures or figures from myth.
