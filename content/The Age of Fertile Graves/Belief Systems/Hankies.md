Organization, Ideology, [[Tyrkysia]], Loosely associated groups of rebels, artists, and misfits

The Have-Not Kids, shortened to Hankies, are a decentralized group whose ideologies spawned among the young nomads and raiders of the fetid moors of [[Lon]]. 

# Structure
Hankies are often found in large groups, though there is no formal structure that they adhere to. In theory, becoming a Hanky is as easy as declaring yourself one, though the internal culture is such that newcomers are closely monitored and vetted for authenticity before being accepted into the whole. 
# Ideology
Originating from bands of nomads in the the much harsher climate beyond the walls of [[Iulia]], Hankies tend to value ingenuity, folk craftsmanship, creativity, teamwork, and loyalty. They heavily encourage their members to live loudly, dressing eccentrically and adorning themselves in small idols that physically represent parts of who they are, giving no mind to those that may look down on them or judge them for it. The saying goes, "How much of this one life you get are you willing to spend worrying how others see you. Live, today, for you. "
Their attention-grabbing manner of dress and rebellious demeanor often leads those looking from the outside in to mistake them for simple hedonists. There are certainly those who appropriate the verbiage and aesthetics of the Hankies to justify their mindless consumption, however Hankies' indulgence is often motivated by a desire to demonstratively shed societal shackles in the hopes that their onlookers will think to do the same. 
Another common element and cultural leftover among groups of Hankies is a focus on community building and defense.
